# Gastos Logo Direction

_Last updated: 2025-11-25_

Gastos’ logo should reflect its core qualities: calm, minimal, and confident — with a subtle financial/AI nod but no noisy visual metaphors.

This document defines **direction**, not a final logo file. The goal is to give consistent guidance whether the logo is generated by AI, you, or a designer.

## 1. Logo Strategy

For the MVP and early stages:

- Use a **wordmark-first** approach (the word “Gastos”) as the primary logo.
- Introduce a simple, abstract **icon** that can be used in:
  - App favicons
  - Mobile icons
  - Avatars
  - Small components (e.g., empty states)

We want a logo that:

- Works in monochrome (white, black, grey).
- Works on dark backgrounds.
- Doesn’t rely heavily on gradients or complex shapes.

## 2. Wordmark

### 2.1 Typeface

- Base font: **Inter** (to align with in-product typography).
- Style: Medium or Semibold weight.
- Letter case: **Title case** or **Sentence case**: `Gastos`.
- Tracking: Slightly increased tracking (letter spacing) for calm, airy feel.

### 2.2 Variants

1. **Primary Wordmark (Dark UI)**
   - Text color: `foreground` (light grey/white).
   - Usage: App header, splash screen, auth pages.

2. **Inverted Wordmark (Light UI)**
   - Text color: dark grey (`#020617` or similar).
   - Usage: marketing pages on light backgrounds.

## 3. Icon Concept

The icon should be:

- Simple enough to be recognizable at 16x16 pixels.
- Abstract, not literal “wallet” or “piggy bank”.
- Compatible with a dark background.

### 3.1 Concept Directions (Candidates)

You can explore these options later via Figma/AI, but the **direction** is:

1. **Chat Bubble + Plus Sign**
   - A rounded chat bubble, minimal outline.
   - A small “+” inside or at the corner.
   - Symbolizes “add expense via chat.”

2. **Stacked Shapes (Card + Bar)**
   - Two or three rounded rectangles stacked.
   - Suggests a card and a bar chart in minimal form.
   - Represents “spending log + insight”.

3. **G Mark (Abstract ‘G’)**
   - Simplified geometric “G” that can be used as a stand-alone symbol.
   - Combines a circle/arc with a gap suggesting growth or a timeline.

For now, **Chat Bubble + Plus Sign** is the recommended primary direction because it ties directly to the chat-first nature of Gastos.

## 4. Color Usage

To maintain the minimalist aesthetic:

- Default icon: solid or outlined in `foreground` on dark backgrounds.
- Primary accented version:
  - Icon background: `primary` (emerald).
  - Icon content (glyph): `primary-foreground` (dark teal).
- Avoid multi-colored icons; keep it to 1–2 colors max.

Examples:

- Favicon:
  - Background: `#050509`
  - Icon: white/grey outline of chat bubble with a small emerald “+”.
- App icon:
  - Rounded square in emerald with white chat bubble inside.

---

## 5. Spacing & Layout

- The icon should sit comfortably in a square.
- When used alongside the wordmark:
  - Keep consistent padding between icon and text.
  - Do not stretch the icon to be taller than the text height.
- Maintain a minimum clear space around the logo equal to the height of the “G” in “Gastos”.

---

## 6. Do & Don’t

**Do:**

- Keep it simple and geometric.
- Test the logo at very small sizes.
- Ensure readability in one color.

**Don’t:**

- Add gradients, drop shadows, or 3D effects for the base logo.
- Use detailed illustrations or mascots as the main mark.
- Lean on currency symbols (e.g. $, €, ¥) for the primary logo.

---

## 7. Future Expansion

Later, you can introduce:

- Sub-brands (e.g., Gastos Pro, Gastos Business) by extending the wordmark.
- A subtle animation for loading screens:
  - E.g. the chat bubble icon “breathing” or the “+” gently pulsing.

For now, keep all motion extremely subtle and optional — the main logo must stand on its own as a static, minimal mark.

---

## 8. Implementation Priority

1. Implement a **simple wordmark** (`Gastos` in Inter Semibold) as the header logo in the app.
2. Implement a **temporary favicon** using a simple monogram or chat bubble.
3. When time allows, create 3–5 icon explorations following the directions above, then update this doc with the chosen final icon.
