_Last updated: 2025-11-25_

## 1. Brand Overview

**Product name:** Gastos  
**Tagline (WIP):** Track your spending effortlessly.  

**What Gastos is:**  
Gastos is an AI-powered, chat-first spending tracker that lets people record their expenses in seconds — by text, photo, or audio — and makes sense of their spending without forcing them into spreadsheets or complex budgeting tools.

**What makes it different:**

- **Input freedom:** Users can log spending via text, photos of receipts, or audio (voice notes), instead of only using rigid forms.
- **AI-first, not “AI added”:** AI is the default experience for extracting, cleaning, and organizing expense data.
- **Frictionless UX:** Minimal UI, dark-mode first, quick capture. The product gets out of the way so people can log and move on.

## 2. Mission, Vision, and Promise

### 2.1 Mission

Help people stay aware of their spending by making expense logging so effortless that it actually becomes a habit.

### 2.2 Vision

Become the default way for individuals to log and understand their spending — regardless of how they choose to input it (text, photo, audio, or future formats like video/livestream).

### 2.3 Brand Promise

- **To users:** “If you spend it, you can log it in seconds — and we’ll keep it organized for you.”
- **To yourself (internal):** Don’t ship features that make logging slower, more complex, or cognitively heavier.

## 3. Target Users (Initial Focus)

**Primary persona:**  
Young professionals and busy knowledge workers (initially in ASEAN) who:

- Want to be more mindful of their spending,
- Hate spreadsheets and manual budgeting,
- Often forget to log expenses after the fact,
- Are comfortable using chat-like interfaces and AI.

**Core jobs-to-be-done:**

1. **“I just spent money, let me log it quickly.”**  
   - Log an expense in under 10 seconds.
   - Works even when they’re tired or distracted.

2. **“I want to see where my money is going.”**  
   - Get simple, clear summaries (e.g., this week, this month).
   - No complex charts by default; text-first summaries.

3. **“I don’t want to babysit a budget, but I want to avoid overspending.”**  
   - Gentle awareness, not guilt.
   - Nudges and simple insights instead of lectures.

## 4. Brand Personality

Gastos should feel like a calm, competent assistant — not a finance bro, not a nagging parent.

**Core traits:**

- **Calm** – No panic, no urgency spam.  
- **Clear** – Simple language and uncluttered UI.  
- **Competent** – Feels reliable and accurate.  
- **Respectful** – No shaming about money.  
- **Low-ego** – The user is the hero; Gastos is the tool.

**Not:** playful to the point of silly, edgy, sarcastic, or preachy.

## 5. Brand Principles

These principles guide both product and visual design.

1. **Simplicity > Everything**
   - Every additional UI element must justify its existence.
   - Fewer buttons, fewer states, fewer words.
   - If the same outcome can be achieved with less interaction, do that.

2. **Fast Capture, Deep Clarity**
   - Logging should be fast and lightweight.
   - Understanding should be clear and simple (text + light structure).
   - Gastos is a capture tool first, insight tool second.

3. **Dark-Mode First**
   - Design and test primarily for dark mode.
   - Light mode is a secondary concern.
   - Dark UI should feel calm, not edgy.

4. **AI as a Helpful Assistant, Not a Gatekeeper**
   - AI handles extraction, parsing, and categorization.
   - Users can override and correct easily.
   - Avoid “because AI said so” vibes; always allow edits.

5. **Respect Users’ Time & Attention**
   - No noisy notifications.
   - No overwhelming dashboards.
   - No guilt-driven copy (“you failed”, “you’re bad with money”).

6. **Consistency Over Cleverness**
   - Use consistent patterns for similar actions.
   - Don’t introduce special-case UI that breaks the mental model.
   - Buttons, labels, and flows should feel familiar across the app.

7. **Progress Over Perfection**
   - Ship minimal but coherent flows.
   - Improve with real usage, not theoretical edge cases.
   - Keep the UX and brand system flexible for iteration.

## 6. Design Aesthetic

**Overall direction:** Minimalist, Apple-inspired, with a slightly stronger emerald identity.

- **Color usage:**
  - Mostly neutral dark greys.
  - Emerald as a confident accent for primary actions and success states.
  - Very limited use of other colors.

- **Typography:**
  - Clean, sans serif (Inter).
  - Relatively small number of sizes and weights.
  - Emphasis via weight and spacing, not random colors.

- **Layout:**
  - Generous negative space.
  - Thin dividers and subtle elevation where needed.
  - No decorative patterns; everything must serve function.

- **Components:**
  - Medium corner radius (not super pill, not sharp).
  - Soft, subtle shadows only where needed (e.g., floating modals, sheets).
  - Clear focus states for keyboard navigation and accessibility.

## 7. Content & Copy Direction

See `voice-tone.md` for detailed writing and tone guidelines.

**Quick anchors:**

- Use short, plain sentences.
- Avoid jargon like “LTV”, “burn rate”, etc. in user-facing copy.
- Prefer “you” and “your spending” instead of abstract, detached wording.

---

## 8. Non-Goals (What Gastos Is Not)

- **Not** a complex, feature-bloated personal finance suite.
- **Not** an investment advisory tool.
- **Not** a hardcore budget punishment system.
- **Not** a gamified app with badges and points (at least not for MVP).

These are intentionally out of scope to protect focus and simplicity.

## 9. Open Questions (To Revisit Later)

- Should Gastos eventually help with budgeting (limits, envelopes), or stay purely as an awareness + logging tool?
- How opinionated should Gastos be about “good” vs “bad” spending?
- How much pro-level detail (currency conversions, multi-account tracking) is needed for power users?
